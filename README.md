## **Abstract**

**Abstract:**  
We present a Python‑based framework for predicting material band gaps from synthetic electronic band structure data using supervised regression with a feedforward neural network. The dataset is procedurally generated by simulating one‑dimensional band structures as noisy combinations of sine waves, with the band gap defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum energy values. This approach provides a controlled environment for testing regression models without requiring experimental or high‑throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  

The neural network architecture consists of two hidden layers (64 and 32 neurons, ReLU activation) and a linear output layer for continuous band gap prediction. The model is trained using mean squared error (MSE) loss and the Adam optimizer, with performance evaluated on a held‑out test set. Visualization tools include:
- Sample synthetic band structures with annotated band gaps
- Model architecture diagrams
- Training and validation loss curves
- Scatter plots comparing predicted vs. true band gaps
